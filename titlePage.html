   <p class="infoFont">Members of the Fisher Center at Bard have united to establish the Anti-Racism and Accessibility Working Groups. These initiatives are dedicated to promoting a more inclusive and accessible environment within the arts community. The working groups are committed to addressing and dismantling systemic barriers, fostering a sense of belonging, and advocating for diversity in all its forms. By collaborating on various projects and initiatives, they aim to create a space where everyone can fully participate and thrive in the arts, regardless of their background or abilities. Members of these groups recognize the ongoing challenges and strive to create meaningful change and support unheard voices in the arts
